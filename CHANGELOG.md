## __WORK IN PROGRESS__ · _Summer is coming!_
### Breaking changes · [Migration guide](https://zwave-js.github.io/node-zwave-js/#/getting-started/migrating-to-v7)
* Renamed `controller.removeNodeFromAllAssocations` to `controller.removeNodeFromAllAssociations` to fix a typo
* We've reworked/fixed the parsing of Node Information Frames (NIF) to match the specifications and changed node properties to make more sense
* No more automatic query of all node values when restarting from cache
* The `deltaTime` and `previousValue` values for the `Meter CC` are no longer exposed
* Numeric loglevels are converted to the corresponding string loglevel internally. `driver.getLogConfig` always returns the string loglevel regardless.
* The `"notification"` event was decoupled from the `Notification CC` and now serves as a generic event for CC-specific notifications.

### Features
* The logger formats were more cleanly separated between logger and transport instances. As a result, writing user-defined transports is now much easier.
* Implemented a `logfmt` transport in https://github.com/zwave-js/log-transports
* Added support for `Entry Control CC`

### Bugfixes
* Changes to the logger configuration are now correctly applied dynamically

## 6.6.1 (2021-03-07)
### Bugfixes
* After a restart, sleeping nodes have their status correctly determined even if they weren't interviewed completely before
* During inclusion, sleeping nodes are no longer marked as asleep after the protocol info was queried
* Fixed the length validation in sequenced Security S0 Message Encapsulation commands
* Unsolicited reports from the root endpoint are now also mapped to higher endpoints when the node supports Multi Channel Association V3+

## 6.0.0 (2021-01-19) · _This is the way_
### Breaking changes · [Migration guide](https://zwave-js.github.io/node-zwave-js/#/getting-started/migrating-to-v6)
* Logging can now be configured through driver options. However, the environment variables for logging are no longer evaluated lazily, so they now need to be set before requiring `zwave-js`.
* The second (string) parameter of the `"interview failed"` event handler was removed
* The type `ValueMetadataBase` has been renamed to `ValueMetadataAny`. The old type `ValueMetadataAny` was merged into `ValueMetadataBase`.
* The retry strategy for sending commands to nodes has been revised. By default, a message is no longer re-transmitted when the node has acknowledged its receipt, since it is unlikely that the retransmission will change anything. The old behavior can be restored by setting the `attempts.retryAfterTransmitReport` driver option to `true`.  
To compensate for the change and give the response enough time to reach the controller, the default for `timeouts.response` has been increased from `1600` to `10000`.
* The driver now distinguishes between stateful and event values. The latter are now exclusively exposed through the `"value notification"` event.
* The deprecated `nodeInterviewAttempts` option was removed
* The options `fs` and `cacheDir` have been renamed to `storage.driver` and `storage.cacheDir`.
* Loggers are now managed on a per-driver basis. This means you can use zwave-js to talk to different controllers and have separate logs for each.
* The `lookupXYZ` methods are no longer exposed by `@zwave-js/config`. Use the `configManager` property of your driver instance instead.

### Config file changes

You can run `npm update @zwave-js/config` in the `zwave-js` install dir to pull the latest config files. For now, a driver restart is required afterwards.

### Features

* A driver option was added to control the filesystem access throttling
* Improved the `label` for `Level low` property in `BatteryCC`

* Added the properties `ready` and `allNodesReady` to the driver to read the status after the corresponding events were emitted
* The node neighbor lists now get updated when a node is removed
* The `refreshValues` method is now exposed on node instances, which allows polling all actuator and sensor values of a node. **Note:** Please read the warnings in the [documentation](https://zwave-js.github.io/node-zwave-js/#/api/node?id=refreshvalues)!
* The controller event callback types are now exported

### Bugfixes
* Fixed an off-by-one error in the `Binary Sensor Supported Report` bitmask.  
**Note:** If your devices are affected by this bug, re-interview them to remove corrupted values.

* Added two missing "specific device types"
* Switched the basic device type for Routing Slave and Static Controller
* If a device sends multiple `NonceGet` requests in a row, the duplicate requests are now ignored instead of aborting the previous transaction

### Changes under the hood

* PRs titles are now enforced to comply with conventional commits
* Config json files are now automatically formatted in VSCode and linted
* While editing device config files, supporting IDEs can now use a JSON schema to help you
